The Connection between the API module and the Blockchain module(Bramblechain) is very secure as the reward from the reward pool is distributed with the API directly to the users.

The security of the API will be ensured by an OAuth 2.0  module ( which is an authorization framework used by the likes of Google and Facebook ). Also the reward transactions will be time stamped in the server to make it more secure.
