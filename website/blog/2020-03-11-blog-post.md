In this phase the Bramble REST API Connection Module is sent to the game / application developer. He will accordingly make the REST API calls and check if the API is correctly working for him. ( It's a simple Javascript implementation for the connection to the Oauth module ). A bit of back and forth feedback will happen at this stage. Bramble Team will make changes considering the feedback you give.
