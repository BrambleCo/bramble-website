Bramblechain is a public blockchain and its main modules are:

1) Consensus / Staking Layer 

Bramblechain uses the Proof of stake algorithm. It is a type of consensus algorithm by which a cryptocurrency blockchain network aims to achieve distributed consensus. In PoS-based cryptocurrencies the creator of the next block is chosen via various combinations of random selection and wealth or age (i.e., the stake). In contrast, the algorithm of proof-of-work-based cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin uses mining; that is, the solving of computationally intensive puzzles to validate transactions and create new blocks.

2) P2P Networking

This module connects different miners / validators together to maintain the consensus.

3) P2P Transaction Module

The  peer-to-peer transactions of the blockchain will be happen in this layer

4) Staking Rewards

These generated from the Bramblechain are distributed among the two entities that are:
a) Stakers  
b) Reward Pool
This reward pool is further divided amongst the developers and the users.

5) Sharding

The blockchain network is the database with the nodes representing individual data servers. If we apply sharding to blockchain, this would mean breaking up the blockchain network into individual segments (or shards). Each shard would hold a unique set of smart contracts and account balances.

Nodes would then be assigned to individual shards to verify transactions and operations, instead of each being responsible for verifying every transaction on the entire network.

The idea is that, by breaking up the blockchain into more manageable segments, it should lead to increased throughput of transactions and therefore overcome the scalability issues faced by most of the major blockchains today. Weâ€™ll look at this in more detail a bit further down.
