Programmable Crypto Rewards API for Apps & Games

## Vision

To make cryptocurrency accessible and usable to every person on the planet.

## Objectives and Goals

To increase engagement & revenue of an app or game by rewarding users in Bramble

### User Interaction Design

The current implementation of Blockchain is not meant for regular/novice users. Added steps to ensure privacy, decentralization while maintaining the usability aspect of the app has further made things complex.

Focusing more on user interface i.e. making it easy for non-tech users to access cryptocurrency, abstracting the core-tech of blockchain to get a product-market fit. This ensures that users can use the app without the knowledge of private keys, public keys, gas charges etc.
